simpleNeuralNetwork
===================


Summary:
Project follows a reasonable abstraction to support a variety of
different neuronal training.  Currently only feed-forward training is
implemented and is dated (started ~2003).  Future work would be to modernize the
project and add the remaining training capabilities.


Run Tests 
=========
- See: src/UT_adaline.java

Run AWT 2D-GUI
=========
- See: src/AdalineGUI.java

Modernization Todo:
=========
[ ] Remove typecasting
[ ] add junit test (pull apart UT_adaline.java)
[ ] Replace adalineGUI with Jetty + d3 visualization (webify the project)

Training Todo:
=========
[ ] Add additional networks
